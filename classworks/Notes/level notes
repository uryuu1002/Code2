3 levels

when you finish all the blocks, the level changes.

how would we store the information of what level we're on?

int level = ol
level ++;

if (level < MAX) {
	level ++;
}

// if there is a gameover scene when all life is used up

int level = ol
level ++;

if (level < MAX) {
	level ++;
}

if (lives <= 0){
	level = 0;
}

// if there is a object that allows the player to jump 3 levels ahead

if (MAX - level > 3){
	level += 3;
}
